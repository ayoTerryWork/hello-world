Hello to later versions of myself dont give up.  You are so close.  Pleas learn to code.   There are many jobs in oxford for coders
Even if you dont get the Job in ruby you can still finish learning java and do stuff with the Amazon API.  Also look for other part time stop gap jobs whilst increasing your ministry.
